# Netflix_Recommender_System_Model_Proposal

The purpose of this project is to propose several viable recommender systems by introducing metrics, implementing several  models, evaluating performance, and understanding the recommendation dynamics.

This is the final project for NYU DS-GA 1001 Intro to Data Science.

## Data

Data comes from kaggle [MovieLens 100K Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset).

## Code

baseling-model: implemented several baseline models: only mean of the ratings, weighed mean, SVM, gradient boosting, etc.

surprise: implemented several recommender system models from packege surprise: SVD, SCD++, NMF, kNN, and performed stacking.

evaluation: tested model accuracy, coverage, diversity through several metrics.


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
